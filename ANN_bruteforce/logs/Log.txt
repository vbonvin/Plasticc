Step 1:
    Question of Standardisation/Normalisation:
    - Which algo to use - Quantile Transformer isn't bad
    - Over same type of features and 1 sample
        - Did without standardising the coordinates and the redshifits
        - try again without coordinates
    - Over same type of feature and all sample? -> storing of mean and std neccesary
    - Over 1 features and all samples? -> with boot straping helps a lot. No overfitting, accuracy of 0.75
